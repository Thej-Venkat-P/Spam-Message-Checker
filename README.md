# Spam-Message-Checker
Checks for spam Messages and Dangerous URLs in the Message using Machine Learning Algorithm
This is a Python program that uses a Machine Learning model to classify text messages as spam or ham (not spam). The program also can detect Harmful or Dangerous URLs present in the Message and Shows if they are Dangerous.

#Requirements
The program requires the following files and libraries to be in the same directory or imported:
•	Python Programming Language with an IDE
•	Dataset for Training the Machine Learning model
•	Python File with functions to check for Safety of URL
•	Pandas module
•	Sklearn module
•	Re module

#Setup
To run this program, you will need the following:
•	Python 3.8 or higher (Download Python | Python.org)
•	The DataSet file “spam.csv”, which contains the data for training and testing the Machine learning model.
•	The Python file “urlSafety.py”, which contains the function for checking the safety of a URL.
•	The following Python libraries: pandas, sklearn, and re. You can install them using the command “pip install pandas sklearn“ in the Command Terminal.
