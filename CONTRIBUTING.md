# How to add new dataset csv files  
One of the main ways to contribute to this project is to add new dataset csv files that can be used for training the ML model.  
If you have a dataset csv file that you want to share with the project, please follow these steps:  

-Fork the project repository and create a new branch for your changes.  
-Place your dataset csv file in the data folder of the project. Please make sure that your file has a descriptive name and follows the [csv format].  
-Add a README.md file in the same folder as your dataset csv file. The README.md file should contain the following information:  
--The name and source of the dataset  
--A brief description of the dataset and its features  
--Any license or citation information for the dataset  
--Any preprocessing or cleaning steps that you applied to the dataset  
--Any limitations or caveats of the dataset  
-Commit and push your changes to your forked repository.  
-Create a pull request from your branch to the main branch of the project repository.  
  Please provide a clear and concise title and description for your pull request, and explain why your dataset csv file is useful or relevant for the project.  
-Wait for the project maintainers to review and merge your pull request. You may be asked to make some changes or provide some feedback before your pull request is accepted.  
  
Thank you for adding new dataset csv files to the project! Your contribution is greatly appreciated.
